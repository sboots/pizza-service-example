		<h2>Providing content in Canada's official languages</h2>
        <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/">Official Languages Act</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-48/index.html">Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations</a>&nbsp;and Treasury Board policy requirements establish when we use both English and French to provide services to or communicate with members of the public.

        <h2>Our commitment to accessibility</h2>
        <p>The Government of Canada is committed to achieving a high standard of accessibility as defined in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601">Standard on Web Accessibility</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27088">Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices</a>. In the event of difficulty using our Web pages, please contact us for assistance or to obtain alternative formats such as regular print, Braille or another appropriate format.</p>
        <h2>Our social media terms of use</h2>
        <h3>Content and frequency</h3>
        <p>TBS uses social media accounts as an alternative method of sharing the content posted on this site and interacting with stakeholders. By following TBS&rsquo;s social media accounts (by &quot;following,&quot; &quot;liking&quot; or &quot;subscribing&quot;), you can expect to see information about the programs and services TBS provides and how they can benefit you.</p>
        <p>TBS understands that the Web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at any time. You can expect to see new content posted at various times; however, TBS&rsquo;s accounts are usually monitored Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (ET). Comments submitted after these hours or on weekends will be read and responded to as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Because the servers of social media platforms are managed by a third party, TBS&rsquo;s social media accounts are subject to downtime that may be out of TBS&rsquo;s control. As such, TBS accepts no responsibility for platforms becoming unresponsive or unavailable.</p>
        <h3>Links to other websites</h3>
        <p>TBS&rsquo;s social media accounts may post or display links for websites that are not under TBS&rsquo;s control. These links are provided solely for the convenience of users. TBS is not responsible for the information found through these links, nor does it endorse the sites or their content.</p>
        <h3>Following, favouriting, liking, posting and subscribing</h3>
        <p>TBS&rsquo;s decision to &quot;follow,&quot; &quot;favourite&quot;, &quot;subscribe&quot;, &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;post&rdquo; to another social media account does not imply an endorsement of that account, channel, page or site, and neither does sharing (re-tweeting, reposting or linking) content from another user.</p>
        <h3>Comments and interaction</h3>
        <p>TBS will read comments and participate in discussions when appropriate. We ask that your comments be relevant and respectful. TBS reserves the right to delete comments that violate this notice, and the user may be blocked and reported to prevent further inappropriate comments.</p>
        <p>TBS cannot engage in issues of party politics or answer questions that break the rules of this notice.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to edit or remove comments that:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Contain personal information;</li>
         <li>Are contrary to the principles of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;</li>
         <li>Express racist, hateful, sexist, homophobic, slanderous, insulting or life-threatening messages;</li>
         <li>Put forward serious, unproven or inaccurate accusations against individuals or organizations;</li>
         <li>Are aggressive, coarse, violent, obscene or pornographic;</li>
         <li>Are offensive, rude or abusive to an individual or an organization;</li>
         <li>Are not sent by the author or are put forward for advertising purposes;</li>
         <li>Encourage illegal activity;</li>
         <li>Contain announcements from labour or political organizations;</li>
         <li>Are unintelligible or irrelevant;</li>
         <li>Are repetitive or spam; and</li>
         <li>Do not, in our opinion, add to the normal flow of the discussion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, please be respectful and make sure that your comments are relevant to where they are posted. The views of users commenting on our social media accounts do not represent the views of TBS.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility of social media platforms</h3>
        <p>Social media platforms are third-party service providers and are not bound by Government of Canada standards for Web accessibility.</p>
        <p>If you have difficulty accessing content on our social media accounts, please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:questions@tbs-sct.gc.ca">contact us</a>&nbsp;and we will provide you with the information in a different format.</p>
        <h3>Copyright</h3>
        <p> Information that we post is subject to the&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/index.html">Copyright Act</a>.</p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>TBS&rsquo;s use of social media serves as an extension of its presence on the Web. Social media account(s) are public and are not hosted on TBS servers. Users who choose to interact with us via social media should read the terms of service and privacy policies of these third-party service providers and those of any applications used to access them.</p>
        <h3>Official Languages</h3>
        <p>Many social media platforms have multiple language options and provide instructions on how to set your preferences. TBS respects the&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/">Official Languages Act</a>&nbsp;and is committed to ensuring that our information is available in both French and English and that both versions are of equal quality.</p>
        <p>TBS replies to comments in the official language in which they are posted. If TBS thinks the response is a question of general public interest, we may post in both official languages.</p>
        <p>TBS may share links that direct users to sites of organizations or other entities that are not subject to the&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/">Official Languages Act</a>&nbsp;and available only in the language(s) in which they are written. When content is available in only one language, we make an effort to provide similar content in the other official language.</p>
