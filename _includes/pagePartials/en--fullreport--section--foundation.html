    <p>As the Government of Canada improves its use of digital technologies, it must ensure that the foundational technological elements needed to succeed are in place. In 2016, TBS released a new <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/information-technology-strategy.html">IT Strategic Plan</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/cloud-computing/government-canada-cloud-adoption-strategy.html">Cloud Adoption Strategy</a>, which provide direction on some of these foundational elements. However, it was noted that not all parts of the Government of Canada IT ecosystem are evolving at the same pace, making it difficult for the Government as a whole to harness the full potential of digital transformation. Feedback from participants and the experience of other jurisdictions underlines that the right horizontal enablers need to be in place to build a truly digital government.</p>
    <p>The following five key issues surfaced through discussions with stakeholders:</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843352"></a>Challenging Procurement Practices</h3>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-right section--foundations">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box: </em>In 2016, the City of Guelph launched a new <a href="http://open.guelph.ca/accelerator/">Civic Accelerator program</a>, that connects innovative start-up companies with municipal departments to solve city challenges. The program allows selected start-ups to collaborate with, learn from, and test their new technology solutions with city staff in real-world applications. City staff, in turn, can experiment with and assess creative potential solutions outside of the traditional procurement process. The two initially-selected start-ups <a href="http://guelph.ca/2017/02/pilot-programs-announced-guelph-wraps-first-round-civic-accelerator/">have now completed the year-long program</a>, and are bringing their solutions into the market.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Existing procurement practices were identified as preventing small scale, iterative development with the private sector, and as making it difficult for start-ups and non-traditional players to work with government:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feedback received indicated that existing IT procurement practices present a number of roadblocks to smaller players. Generally, large-scale Requests for Proposals (RFPs) are issued to minimize how frequently a department needs to go to market. These large RFPs prevent smaller organizations from applying, given the scale, complexity, and associated resource requirements. Providing guidance on how to do iterative and smaller-scale procurement, including for open source software solutions, similar to <a href="https://micropurchase.18f.gov/">18F&rsquo;s micro-purchase framework</a> or <a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/">GDS&rsquo; Digital Marketplace</a>, was raised by many of the stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Many start-ups demonstrated interest in working with governments in non-traditional ways, to help solve problems while proving their business models. The federal government remains one of the largest potential markets in Canada for businesses, and many start-ups expressed that while they would welcome the opportunity to work with government, they don&rsquo;t believe they have an opportunity or mechanism to do so. Participants proposed solutions such as government releasing &ldquo;problems&rdquo; or &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; for which start-ups can pitch solutions &ndash; similar to the Civic Accelerator models that the cities of Guelph and Montreal have been piloting.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-left  section--foundations">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box: </em>Montreal&rsquo;s start-up community launched <a href="http://innocitemtl.ca/en/le-programme/">InnoCit&eacute;&nbsp;MTL</a> in 2015, an incubator program that accelerates start-ups specializing in urban innovation and smart cities. InnoCit&eacute;&nbsp;MTL partners start-ups with the City of Montreal and other institutions and companies in the city, helping them develop and improve their products with real-world data and guidance from experts. Several of InnoCit&eacute;&nbsp;MTL&rsquo;s start-ups <a href="https://quartierinnovationmontreal.com/en/business-vision/innocite-mtl-startup-accelerator-canadas-smart-city">have now become internationally-competitive technology companies</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843353"></a>Cloud and Open Source Technologies</h3>
    <p>The use of cloud and open source technologies were identified as foundational elements for digital innovation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many industry representatives expressed that while the publishing of TBS&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/cloud-computing/government-canada-cloud-adoption-strategy.html">Cloud Adoption Strategy</a> in 2016 was an important first step, there remain significant barriers to government use of cloud computing. At the provincial and municipal level, uncertainty about data residency requirements for use of cloud computing was identified as having slowed the adoption of innovative cloud services.</li>
        <li>Participants underlined that open source platforms have become an increasingly important foundational element for digital transformation in public sector organizations across the world. Digital transformation teams in the US and the UK have emphasized the critical role of open source in their successes to date, with the UK&rsquo;s Government Digital Service <a href="https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/18/welcome-to-our-new-open-source-lead/">appointing an Open Source Lead</a> who spearheads efforts to collaborate and share with open source communities around the world.</li>
        <li>While the Government of Canada has taken initial steps towards the use of open source, there remains a lack of familiarity and comfort with the use of open source across the organization as a whole. Key open source projects include the <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew">Web Experience Toolkit</a> and the internal <a href="https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcconnex">GCconnex collaboration platform</a>, which have since been adopted and built upon by other jurisdictions. At the 2016 Open Government Partnership Summit, the Government of Canada <a href="https://paris-declaration.ogpsummit.org/topic/58205fce2fd812b46ab9faa5">committed to share its experiences</a> with open source collaboration platforms, and to convene a virtual conference on open source in government.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-right  section--foundations">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box:</em> The City of Saskatoon <a href="https://www.saskatoon.ca/">developed its new city website</a> based on the Web Experience Toolkit, a set of visual templates and tools designed to create websites that are accessible, interoperable, mobile-friendly and multilingual. The Web Experience Toolkit was developed by the Government of Canada and is <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew">published on GitHub as an open-source project</a>, allowing other organizations to easily re-use and adapt the toolkit for their own websites.</p>
    </div>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843354"></a>Digital Identity</h3>
    <p>Digital identity was identified as a key building block to enable better digital services across the Government of Canada and between jurisdictions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the foundational elements for digital service delivery is digital identity: unless a citizen can easily confirm who they are online, they cannot access services that require identity validation. While any department providing online services currently uses an authentication method of some kind, a lack of consistency across federal government departments was identified. Similarly, a lack of consistent approaches was noted as preventing the use of a shared digital identity that could enable citizens to access services across levels of government.</li>
        <li>There has been some progress on digital identity in recent years that was noted, including Cyber Authentication Renewal and standardized authentication services of SecureKey Concierge and GCKey. These services allow users to use their credential of choice from selected financial institutions or from the Government of Canada to access online government services. The Canada Revenue Agency and Service Canada also recently launched a program that <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/esrvc-srvce/tx/ndvdls/myccnt/srvccnd-eng.html">allows users to easily switch</a> from one department&rsquo;s secure website to the other, without signing in again. Other progress includes the development of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/2016/08/11/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>, which standardizes processes for trusting digital identities across jurisdictions.</li>
        <li>Despite these foundational elements, many participants expressed a desire for the federal government to play a stronger leadership role, and to pilot digital identity solutions across jurisdictional boundaries.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843355"></a>Legacy Systems</h3>
    <p>One of the issues raised by many public sector stakeholders was the struggle that governments have with the need to maintain mission-critical legacy systems while at the same time experimenting and prototyping new solutions in an agile way:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Government of Canada &ndash; like many other jurisdictions &ndash; continues to maintain thousands of legacy IT systems that underpin mission-critical services. While some departments have programs in place to modernize these systems, legacy infrastructure must be maintained until services can be fully migrated to modern platforms.</li>
        <li>Participants underlined that while integrating state-of-the-art digital services with older platforms presents a variety of challenges, work can still be undertaken to build client-facing, user-centric services that are connected to legacy systems.</li>
        <li>Governments are not alone in facing these challenges. It was noted that financial institutions provide a useful point of comparison, as they face similar issues related to organizational size, culture, and dependency on legacy systems. Despite these challenges, many financial institutions have successfully modernized client-facing services dramatically over the past decade, despite maintaining a variety of legacy IT systems behind the scenes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843356"></a>Digital Literacy</h3>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-left  section--foundations">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box: </em><a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/">Ladies Learning Code</a> is a Canadian non-profit organization dedicated to promoting collaborative, technological learning among women and youth. The organization runs workshops that teach coding and technical skills, and plays a significant role in improving digital literacy in Canada. Ladies Learning Code runs workshops in <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/about/">more than 30 cities across Canada</a>, and more than 25,000 people have participated since the program&rsquo;s launch in 2011. In 2016, the organization announced a new initiative &ndash; <a href="http://www.canadalearningcode.ca/">Canada Learning Code</a> &ndash; that aims to teach digital skills to 10 million Canadians within the next decade.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Broader digital literacy was identified as being needed across government, at all levels and functions, to support smart decision-making in a world where increasingly all policy issues, programs and services have a digital component:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many stakeholders emphasized that digital literacy needs to become a core skill for every public servant. Public servants at all levels need to understand how technology works to provide sound advice and make good decisions. By extension, digital literacy is critical to understanding the viability, level of effort and cost associated with migrating to new solutions and effective oversight of IT-enabled projects in government.</li>
        <li>It was also raised that the issue of digital literacy should be considered as part of the intake of new public servants. The basics of technology management and coding were identified as something that should be incorporated into the curriculum of public policy schools, in the same way that statistics and economics are now emphasized as part of the basic toolkit of public servants who advise on policy and manage programs in governments.</li>
    </ul>
