    <span>Organizing <br/> &nbsp;to Deliver Digital</span>

<div class="engagement-report-section">
    <p>Looking at the experience of other public sector organisations, it has become clear that incorporating new digital tools, techniques, and approaches into traditional government organizations requires a fundamental reassessment of the traditional vertical accountability structures which characterize the public sector. As demonstrated by jurisdictions across the globe, there has been a move in recent years to organize digital transformation teams differently &ndash; to ensure that modernization efforts transcend departmental silos and have an impact at an enterprise level. In these cases, existing departmental mandates needed to evolve, along with leadership roles within the public sector, to enable efforts to establish dedicated capacity for digital transformation. These processes can be disruptive, making it important to ensure the pace of change is manageable within organizations.</p>
    <p>The following five items surfaced through discussions with stakeholders across Canada related to organizing to deliver digital:</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843333"></a>Focused Leadership</h3>
    <p>International best practices have illustrated the need for strong, horizontal leadership to drive digital transformation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital transformation agencies in other jurisdictions tend to be organized from central agencies (e.g. Cabinet Office, Treasury).</li>
        <li>Horizontal leadership was identified as being important to ensure that digital transformation can move beyond departmental silos, and that services reflect the needs of citizens who do not distinguish between departments or levels of government.</li>
        <li>In many cases, a dedicated champion was mentioned as being critical to help address barriers, create partnership opportunities and garner support across the enterprise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843334"></a>Evolving Leadership Roles</h3>
    <p>A number of stakeholders shared that in recent years their organizations have seen an evolving role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the emergence of Chief Digital Officers (CDO):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditionally, the CIO function has been the <em>de facto</em> leader for all IT-related functions within an organization. Over time, the responsibilities of CIOs have broadened to include any technology-related function. This mandate expansion is more and more untenable, as digital becomes a critical underpinning of every government program and service.</li>
        <li>A recent trend is the emergence of the CDO position, which is seen in a number of jurisdictions across Canada: the City of Vancouver, the Province of Ontario, and several federal institutions including Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) and the National Film Board of Canada. While CIOs are focused on technology functions that relate to the back-office and cyber security, the CDO plays a larger role in business transformation and the use of technology to achieve citizen-facing service objectives. The reporting relationship between these roles varies from organization to organization.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843335"></a>Revolution versus Evolution</h3>
    <p>Striking the optimal balance between revolution and evolution was highlighted by a number of stakeholders as being an important consideration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The experience of some stakeholders was that the size and scope of the federal government makes it difficult to achieve large-scale transformation initiatives in short time-frames, particularly in comparison to the fast-moving pace of the private technology sector.</li>
        <li>A number of participants raised that legitimate reasons exist as to why a revolutionary approach cannot be applied systematically. Some parts of government are meant to evolve slowly by design, and this is often reflected in their legislative and policy frameworks. In addition, mission-critical services that assure the safety and security of Canadians and their personal information must be maintained throughout any transformation process.</li>
        <li>Since some parts of government are able to move more nimbly than others, it was raised that incremental progress should be nourished and encouraged. The size and complexity of government as a whole should not prevent a willingness to undertake small steps towards improved digital service delivery where the right environment for success exists.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843336"></a>&ldquo;Working in the Open&rdquo;</h3>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-right calgary">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box: </em>A number of digital transformation teams have created blogs that share their strategic thinking, design and technical approaches, and results. The <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">UK Government Digital Service blog</a> began this trend in 2011, followed by the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/">18F blog</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService">USDS blog</a> in the United States, the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/">DTA blog</a> in Australia, and the <a href="https://medium.com/ontariodigital">Ontario Digital blog</a> here in Canada. These resources allow digital teams within government to connect and share with the public, the technology community, and counterparts around the world.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The UK&rsquo;s digital transformation agency, the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> has championed &lsquo;working in the open&rsquo; since its inception, as a way to accelerate change across government. It was noted that other jurisdictions have since followed their approach:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital transformation agencies in other jurisdictions have been working in the open through the use of blogs, social media, and the open sharing of code through open source platforms. This allows other departments and jurisdictions to re-use and adapt code and ideas, quickly and at no cost.</li>
        <li>As most departments, governments, and jurisdictions face similar issues, it was noted that &lsquo;working in the open&rsquo; allows best practices to be replicated and scaled, along with solutions to challenges and failures. Reusing digital strategies, standards, and open source code also reduces costs and helps different parts of government coordinate, accelerate change, and support each other.</li>
        <li>Working in the open was also highlighted as being symbolically important, as it demonstrates a different approach to government where employees are trusted and empowered, rather than anonymized in favour of an institutional voice. This symbolic change was felt to be critical not just for earning the credibility and social licence needed to drive change, but also to attract and retain new and dynamic types of talent.</li>
        <li>This approach also demonstrates transparency and fosters greater citizen collaboration with government, both among the technology sector and the broader public. Similar to open government initiatives, efforts to work in the open can help strengthen trust and engagement between citizens and governments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843337"></a>Better Services through Data</h3>
    <p>Data plays a critical role in informing and improving service delivery, despite complex policy and public perception issues surrounding data use and privacy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>At their core, all services run on data, and the ability to use and share data is one of the defining characteristics of service delivery in the digital age. Data sharing enables the integrated, highly-personalized user experiences across digital platforms that citizens are increasingly accustomed to in the private sector.</li>
        <li>It was raised by many stakeholders that in some cases, specific legislative and policy barriers prohibit the sharing of data between government organizations and other levels of government. As much of the legislative and policy framework related to the protection of personal information dates its origins back to a pre-internet era, it was noted that the possibilities for personalized service delivery that could exist in the digital age were not anticipated in the existing &lsquo;web of rules&rsquo; around data usage.</li>
        <li>The impact of perceived public opinion was also raised as a hindrance to rapid change in this area. While there is a widespread sense that the public holds government to a higher standard for data protection and usage than the private sector, little work has been done to explore these assumptions in a quantitative way. Without transforming the conversation about government use of data, it will be difficult to envision a significant leap in the integration and personalization of government services. Many stakeholders suggested that a broader conversation with Canadians around privacy and the use of personal information would be valuable.</li>
    </ul>
