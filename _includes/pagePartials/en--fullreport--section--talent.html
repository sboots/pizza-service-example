    <p>People are at the core of everything that government does, and technology is no exception. Within the Government of Canada, a significant number of people work on issues related to IT, including the more than 17,200 federal employees who are part of the Computer Systems (CS) classification. Stakeholders explained, however, that governments have struggled to keep pace with advances in digital technologies, both through maintaining and further developing the skills of its existing workforce, as well as recruiting and retaining the next generation of top talent. Amongst the more than 17,200 IT workers in the federal government, only 15% are millennials (compared to 24% of the overall public service workforce). The average age of CS employees has increased from 40 in the year 2000, to 46 in 2016. The Government has also struggled to maintain a diverse IT workforce: the percentage of women in the CS category has decreased from 30% in 2000, to 27% in 2016 &ndash; a trend that is even more significant among millennials &ndash; compared to the Public Service as a whole, which has workforce of 55% women. These trends present a significant challenge, particularly in such a rapidly evolving field. Participants raised concerns that, without a concerted effort to renew its workforce, the Government of Canada will continue to fall behind in its ability to leverage new digital tools and technologies to meet rising citizen expectations.</p>
    <p>Through engagement sessions held across the country, the following six items surfaced through discussions with stakeholders on digital talent:</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843339"></a>Connecting with External Talent</h3>
    <p>The federal government needs to find better ways to connect external talent with internal opportunities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For many digital professionals outside of government, the overwhelming consensus was that they do not know how to navigate public service employment opportunities, or where to find competitive opportunities that meet their expectations within the public sector.</li>
        <li>While mechanisms like <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/professional-development/interchange-canada.html">Interchange</a> and newer flexible staffing regimes make it relatively easy and fast for hiring managers to bring outside professionals into government for short-term assignments or indeterminate employment, it was felt that these mechanisms alone are not sufficient to attract talent without a larger external branding and recruitment initiative.</li>
        <li>Even with the right hiring mechanisms in place, most public service managers would not know where to find new digital talent or vice-versa. There is a systematic need for a &ldquo;talent matching service&rdquo; role that can connect top-flight external digital talent &ndash; both new graduates and mid-career professionals &ndash; with opportunities within the Public Service of Canada.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843340"></a>Flexible &ldquo;Tours of Duty&rdquo;</h3>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-left pei">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box: </em><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> was founded in 2009, and connects technology and design professionals with opportunities to improve digital public services in the United States. Code for America runs a program where small teams of developers and designers work within municipal and state governments for year-long fellowships, building innovative digital services and sharing best practices from the technology and design community with government counterparts. Since Code for America was launched, similar programs have been created in <a href="http://www.codeforaustralia.org/">Australia</a>, <a href="http://codefor.de/en/">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://codeforall.org/partners/">a number of other countries</a> around the world.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Stakeholders expressed that while many people within the technology sector are mission-driven and are looking for ways to have a tangible impact, they are in many instances looking for flexibility rather than permanent career options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A sense of mission was identified as being important for many individuals working in the tech sector. While generally not interested in long-term careers within large organizations like the federal government, these individuals are interested in solving problems &ndash; particularly ones through which they can see tangible improvements to public-facing services. The creation of programs like <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> in the United States are very much driven by this concept. Much like military or volunteer service, many professionals are interested in serving their country, even for a short period of time.</li>
        <li>The often-expressed idea that government cannot offer competitive wages to compete for top tech talent would appear, at least in part, to be a myth based on feedback from participants. While a certain percentage of digital professionals are driven primarily by financial benefits that government would not be able to realistically meet, many more are looking for professional fulfillment and meaning that the public service can offer. At the entry level, it was also noted that within the flexibility available to hiring managers in the existing salary bands, these are relatively competitive with entry level positions in large tech companies.</li>
        <li>It was also identified from some participants that public sector work can provide an attractive intellectual challenge for those working in digital, data, and design fields, given the fact that the problems that governments tackle &ndash; at municipal, provincial, and federal levels alike &ndash; are in many cases large in scale and complex.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-right pei">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box: </em>The United States&rsquo; <a href="https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/about/">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> (PIF) program is designed to attract innovators in the technology sector into 12-month terms within the federal government. The fellowship program is highly competitive, and attracts leading technology experts from across the United States. PIF fellows were <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/04/22/the-difference-between-18f-and-usds/">instrumental in the creation</a> of both 18F and USDS in 2014.</p>
    </div>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843341"></a>Engagement with Students and Universities</h3>
    <p>Participants expressed a concern that the federal government needs to engage with design and digital talent in universities and colleges differently and earlier, as traditional recruitment approaches lag behind private sector competitors vying for the same talent pool:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>While government has a competitive advantage in talent recruitment with regard to the sense of mission that it can offer, there was a consistently-expressed theme that there is fierce competition for the next generation of technology workers.</li>
        <li>The private sector was identified as engaging with the next generation of digital talent earlier and earlier, even putting in place programs to reach students at high-school or younger levels to build brand awareness for future career choices. Too often, post-secondary recruitment by government departments was seen to only take place as students are approaching graduation, by which point many will have attractive offers on the table from leading private sector firms and start-ups.</li>
        <li>While the federal government does take in student placements, these programs have largely been drawing from universities and colleges in and around the National Capital Region, given the geographical proximity to most departmental headquarters. Moreover, it was identified that there is a lack of engagement with computer science, data science, and design thinking programs, skills that are increasingly important for government and which have not been targeted in the same way as programs in public policy and administration.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843342"></a>New Models for Co-Creation</h3>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-left pei">
        <p><em class="sr-only">Info box: </em><a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/esrvc-srvce/tx/ndvdls/netfile-impotnet/menu-eng.html">NETFILE</a> provides an application programming interface (API), a software system that allows other companies to build tax filing software that can send information directly to the Canada Revenue Agency. NETFILE has created an ecosystem where <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/esrvc-srvce/tx/ndvdls/netfile-impotnet/crtfdsftwr/menu-eng.html">a variety of vendors</a> are providing digital tax filing solutions, competing on the ease of their user interface and the features provided, and simplifying the tax filing experience for Canadians as a result.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Through the engagement sessions it was suggested that there is an emerging &ldquo;third-way&rdquo; between developing solutions in-house or buying commercially, which leverages models for co-creation with civic tech communities using open source code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditionally, the federal government has either developed technological solutions in-house or procured services from the private sector. It was identified that relying too much on either approach has risks: building in-house can result in a failure to leverage state-of-the-art private sector solutions, while an over-reliance on outsourcing can lead to vendor lock-in and the atrophy of in-house technical capacity.</li>
        <li>The advent of open source platforms and distributed models of collaboration were pointed out as having opened up new possibilities for a hybrid model that enables co-creation between government, civic technology communities and/or start-ups and entrepreneurs.</li>
        <li>It was noted by stakeholders that these approaches are not mutually exclusive. Given the sheer size of the Government of Canada&rsquo;s technology requirements &ndash; with more than $5 billion in annual IT spending &ndash; a mix of building, buying, and co-creating will be required to deliver on the government&rsquo;s digital needs.</li>
        <li>It was also encouraged by some for consideration to be given to the &ldquo;Government as a Platform&rdquo; notion <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000774/ch02.html">coined by Tim O&rsquo;Reilly</a> and <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/29/government-as-a-platform-the-next-phase-of-digital-transformation/">explored further by GDS</a> in the UK. The Government of Canada has taken some early steps in this direction, most notably through the Canada Revenue Agency&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/esrvc-srvce/tx/ndvdls/netfile-impotnet/menu-eng.html">NETFILE</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843343"></a>Talent Beyond the National Capital Region</h3>
    <p>Digital professionals expressed that if they are interested in working for the federal government, they shouldn&rsquo;t need to be physically located in Ottawa:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It was pointed out that requiring digital talent to live in the National Capital Region reduces the government&rsquo;s opportunities to work with Canada&rsquo;s best and brightest. New models that were identified to explore include establishing &ldquo;innovation outposts&rdquo; that bring together different jurisdictions and external talent in a collaborative manner.</li>
        <li>It was noted that a number of organizations &ndash; including financial institutions and large retailers &ndash; are moving towards a model where their digital innovation teams are located outside of corporate headquarters. This creates an opportunity to build a different culture, and also allows these organizations to tap into talent in different regions of Canada.</li>
        <li>Many individuals expressed that moving to the National Capital Region to work for government &ndash; even for a year or two &ndash; would be a significant disincentive. Digital talent in Canada is dispersed across the country, with significant technology hubs in many cities and regions. Participants encouraged the federal government to find ways to tap into talent wherever it is based, not just where the government&rsquo;s existing offices are located. Modern technologies enable employees to work virtually and the Government of Canada should have a national footprint to help sustain the economic viability of local communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843344"></a>Fostering Leading-Edge Talent within Government</h3>
    <p>The Public Service of Canada needs to better leverage the talent already in government, by enabling innovation from within and fostering next-generation communities of practice to improve digital skills:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Given the large IT workforce within the Government of Canada, opportunities to better harness the existing talent base were identified as an important need. Programs like the GCconnex Jobs Marketplace, NRCan&rsquo;s Free Agent pilot, and micro-missions are a start, but there is a need to go further.</li>
        <li>Continuous learning was an important takeaway from these discussions. Particularly for the existing CS workforce within the federal government, finding ways to build digital capacity and promote professional development is increasingly important. Many of the areas of expertise now emphasized within the private sector &ndash; particularly user-centric design, cloud computing, and agile development skills &ndash; were identified as still being rare within government. It was offered by a number of participants that building up the skills and expertise of the CS workforce could take place through strategies that include mentorship, coaching, workshops, exchange or rotational programs with other jurisdictions, and job shadowing.</li>
        <li>Beyond the CS workforce, it was identified that there is a need to improve digital literacy writ large. Given that technology increasingly underpins nearly all policy issues, programs and services, public servants at all levels require basic knowledge of how technology works to provide sound advice and make informed decisions.</li>
    </ul>
