    <h2 style="margin-top: 0.5em;">The Case for Digital Government</h2>
    <p>Technological advances, coupled with the private sector&rsquo;s responsiveness to client demands have resulted in rising citizen expectations for digital service delivery. Financial institutions allow clients to quickly check balances, transfer funds or pay bills through mobile applications. Online retailers offer more selection, delivery on demand, and easy returns. Uber, Airbnb and other organizations active in the &ldquo;sharing economy&rdquo; are disrupting and overhauling established industries. In a digital era where citizens expect responsive and seamless service, governments must rise to the challenge. While private sector firms have shifted to a delivery model where &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an app for that,&rdquo; too often the response from government remains &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a paper form for that&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) <a href="http://www.oecd.org/gov/digital-government/Recommendation-digital-government-strategies.pdf">defines digital government</a> as:</p>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;&hellip;the rethinking of government policy, program and service delivery through digital enablers, as an integrated part of governments&rsquo; modernization strategies, to create public value. [Digital government] relies on and enables an ecosystem that connects government, non-governmental organizations, businesses, citizens&rsquo; associations and individuals to support the production of and access to data, services and content through interactions with the government.&rdquo;</blockquote>
    <p>Digital government extends beyond electronic service delivery and self-service. It touches every facet of how governments manage service delivery, and engage citizens and stakeholders &ndash; and leverages digital advances to allow citizens to access services anywhere, anytime. In the long run, digital government can help build stronger engagement and trust between citizens and government, and make public institutions more inclusive, effective, accountable and transparent.</p>
    <p>When Government of Canada services began to be migrated online in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Canada was seen as a world leader. In the <a href="http://workspace.unpan.org/sites/Internet/Documents/UNPAN96407.pdf">2016 United Nations (UN) e-government index</a>, Canada slipped three positions to a ranking of 14th overall &ndash; just behind other jurisdictions who have made significant efforts to reform digital service delivery (i.e. the United States who ranked 12th, and Estonia who ranked 13th). The United Kingdom and Australia ranked first and second overall, both having established distinct digital service organizations.</p>
    <div class="comment-panel comment-panel-left section--intro">
        <p>Despite the Government of Canada&rsquo;s early successes, there is room for improvement. The <a href="http://oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201311_02_e_38796.html">2013 Fall Report of the Office of the Auditor General on Access to Online Services</a> painted a picture of a disjointed and inefficient approach to digital service delivery in Canada, a point emphasized again in the <a href="http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201611_00_e_41829.html">2016 Fall Report of the OAG</a> which pointed out how few online services were focused on citizen needs. While the 2014 <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27916">Policy on Service</a> and a number of departmental initiatives to improve service delivery have helped address some of these issues, efforts need to be accelerated at a whole-of-government level for Canada to be a world leader again.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Organizational size, scope of change and complexity of delivery have been identified as factors that can slow government efforts to modernize service delivery, adapt to changing priorities and expectations, and take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by improved digital technologies and tools. Limited capacity to recruit, retain and harness top digital talent in public sector organizations exacerbates this lack of responsiveness. To remain relevant and responsive in a digital world, governments must accelerate their drive towards modernization and better exploit the potential of digital in its service design and delivery. This digital government transformation is not just about procuring the latest technology or redesigning websites or online services &ndash; it is about harnessing new technologies, skills, and approaches to modernize government, and by doing so, improve the lives of citizens.</p>
    <h3><a name="_Toc476843330"></a>What Other Governments are Doing</h3>
    <p>Governments worldwide and at every level are facing similar issues around digital transformation. Many countries have developed targeted strategies, to better leverage digital opportunities that can meet client needs and expectations. Many jurisdictions such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have also responded by creating dedicated digital service organizations that focus on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User-centric service innovation
        </li>
        <li>Rapid prototyping of digital solutions</li>
        <li>Procurement reform to more effectively deploy technological advances</li>
        <li>Better use of data to improve services and measure results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The mandates of these digital service organizations vary in terms of both scope and maturity. A scan of the experiences of other jurisdictions reveals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The United Kingdom launched the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> (GDS) in 2011 to make services simpler, faster, clearer and digital by default. It made waves by working in full view of the public, and by using open source software and enlisting award-winning design expertise. GDS has also played a central role in managing IT spending across the UK government, reforming procurement systems for IT, and establishing digital standards to assess the quality of online services.</li>
        <li>New Zealand established the <a href="https://webtoolkit.govt.nz/blog/digital-transformation-team/">Digital Transformation Team</a> in 2013 to work with agencies to adopt a user-centric approach and to deliver simpler, seamless, end-to-end services around important life events.</li>
        <li>The United States established <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> in 2014, along with the <a href="https://www.usds.gov/">US Digital Service</a>, to help transform the federal government&rsquo;s IT efforts and improve public-facing digital services. While the US Digital Service sits within the Executive Office of the President, the more project-based 18F (Technology Transformation Service) operates in a cost-recovery model as part of the Government Services Agency. Both teams use open source software extensively and recruit talent from both established technology companies and start-ups in places like Silicon Valley. Both US digital offices have also done significant work on procurement processes to allow for open source approaches and participation of smaller companies.</li>
        <li>The Australian government established the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/">Digital Transformation Agency</a> (DTA, previously the Digital Transformation Office) in 2015 to work with agencies to invest in technology that underpins digital services, to lead the transformation of government services to deliver a better experience for Australians, and to provide guidance and oversight on government IT spending. The DTA jump-started its work by adopting design standards and tools directly from GDS in the UK.</li>
        <li>Other governments have accomplished some significant, and in some cases ground breaking, progress, such as Estonia&rsquo;s <a href="https://e-estonia.com/">e-Estonia</a> Digital Society initiative. Estonia&rsquo;s digital infrastructure &ndash; including a citizen e-ID system, digital signatures, and X-road, a secure data exchange layer used by banks, other businesses, and public services alike &ndash; has a level of security and reliability that is unmatched around the world.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Canada, Ontario has created a <a href="https://medium.com/ontariodigital">Digital Government Team</a> within the Cabinet Office to lead the strategic implementation of the government&rsquo;s digital agenda and drive government-wide transformation. The Government of Ontario appointed a Minister responsible for Digital Government, and a Deputy Minister-level position of Chief Digital Officer is also being established. There have also been examples at the municipal level in Canada of focused digital strategies and organizational reform, such as in Vancouver with the creation of a Chief Digital Officer to drive digital transformation across the municipal government or the City of Calgary&rsquo;s launch of its digital strategy in 2014.</p>
    <p>Within the Government of Canada, the activities being conducted by central digital service offices in other countries are dispersed throughout the system and generally at lower levels of maturity. While the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) plays an oversight role on large IT investments and sets overall direction on service standards and the use of IT, ultimately it has been up to individual departments to determine how they use and incorporate technology or adopt digital approaches to support service delivery &ndash; as departments remain directly accountable for service delivery to their clients. While there are pockets of innovation across the digital service delivery landscape in the federal government, this has led to a patchwork of disconnected approaches and a lack of strategic direction. This makes it difficult for departments to apply user-centric approaches to service delivery, or to introduce agile methodologies that prototype and incorporate user feedback into the service development process in a consistent way. With recent commitments by the government to improve service delivery for Canadians, the time was right to start exploring what a Made-in-Canada approach to digital government should look like.</p>
