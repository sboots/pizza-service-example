		<!-- <h2><a name="_Toc476843327"></a>Executive Summary</h2>
		<p>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) undertook a series of engagement sessions on digital government, soliciting ideas and perspectives on an emerging Government of Canada approach to improving digital service delivery. Between September 2016 and February 2017, TBS &nbsp;met with numerous stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds, in 20 cities and 10 provinces and territories across Canada. This included provincial and municipal governments, technology sector companies, start-ups and business incubators, civic tech organizations, and academic institutions.</p>
		<p>This report highlights the feedback received during these engagement sessions, as well as lessons learnt from other governments around the world that are pursuing innovative approaches to digital transformation. Many stakeholders spoke of the challenges they faced because of outdated or difficult-to-use online services. Partners in municipal and provincial governments spoke of the barriers they faced in hiring and retaining digital talent, or in adopting new approaches to user-centric design and technology implementation into traditional government structures and processes.</p>
		<p>In engagement sessions held with stakeholders across Canada, a wide range of ideas and perspectives were put forward, helping inform a way forward on a made-in-Canada approach to digital government. This feedback included:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Putting user needs first, ahead of government processes</li>
			<li>The need for strong, horizontal leadership to drive digital transformation</li>
			<li>&ldquo;Working in the open&rdquo; to accelerate change across departments and jurisdictions</li>
			<li>The critical role that data and digital identity plays in improving service delivery, and the complex policy and public perception issues surrounding privacy and data use across organizations and jurisdictions</li>
			<li>The need to find better ways to connect external talent with opportunities within government and to engage with the next generation of digital talent</li>
			<li>Harnessing the IT workforce already in government by enabling innovation from within and addressing skills gaps in the areas of user-centric design and agile development</li>
			<li>Re-thinking procurement to identify ways to enable start-up organizations and non-traditional players to work with government and co-create solutions</li>
			<li>The importance of cloud computing and open source technologies as foundational elements for innovation in digital service delivery</li>
			<li>The need for broader digital literacy across government at all levels, to support informed decision-making as increasingly all policy issues, programs and services have digital components</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Best practices and success stories at both the municipal and provincial levels are raising the bar for digital service delivery by the Government of Canada. Meanwhile, jurisdictions worldwide are facing similar challenges, particularly as citizen expectations for digital services are outpacing governments&rsquo; ability to improve and deliver these services. Many countries &ndash; including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Estonia &ndash; have developed digital strategies or established central digital transformation teams to tackle this challenge in new ways.</p>
		<p>This engagement report represents only the beginning of a conversation on what the future of digital government looks like in Canada &ndash; the opportunities are great and there remains much work to be done. The stakeholder engagement undertaken here was intended, in part, to build a network of digital government practitioners across Canada to enable the sharing of experiences on an ongoing basis. In that spirit, your ideas, feedback, and comments are welcome &ndash; please stay in touch by using the comment function at the bottom of this report, or by reaching out via email at <a href="mailto:engage@tbs-sct.gc.ca">engage@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/TBS_Canada">@TBS_Canada</a> or using the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GCdigital?src=hash">#GCdigital</a> hashtag.</p>
